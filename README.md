# MIPS32 Pipeline (Verilog)

This repository contains my Verilog implementation of a 5-stage MIPS32 pipeline CPU.
The project was developed and simulated in **Xilinx Vivado** (no FPGA hardware used).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `src/` â€“ Synthesizable design files (MIPS32 pipeline implementation)
- `tb/` â€“ Testbench for simulation
- `screenshots/` â€“ Simulation results and waveform 
Simulation was run in Vivado Behavioral Simulation.  
Here is an example waveform of instruction execution:
